  The angles in the video is a Synchronization deadlock
By the video we can see that the 4 angels look at each other
by this position:
A---B
|\ /|
|	X	|	
|/ \|
C---D
As we can see that, each angle look at the three other angles,
for each angle, there is a dead lock chain such that:

A -> B/C/D -> A
B -> A/C/D -> B
C -> A/B/D -> C
D -> A/B/C -> D

So the only way to elimate the dead lock is to remove any of the 3 angles since none of the angle can move right now.
So is it a Synchronization deadlock
