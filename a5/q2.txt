i) 
the input value is 100 10 60000
* the result is average by 3 experiment
* not including AUTO since I did not implement it yet


EXT: 7.08u 2.41s 0:10.74r
INT: 7.28u 3.04s 0:12.11r
INTB: 15.10u 4.38s 0:21.06r
TASK: 8.73u 3.83s 0:14.04r

ii)
By the result above we can see that the run time for external, internal is close, which means
these two types of scheduling does not have too much difference on runtime. For the INTB it is 
obvious longer than the rest of three since it includes barging which waste more time.
TASK is a little bit longer than EXT and INT. Since I did not implement AUTO, but I guess it will
be close to EXT and INT, since the way of implement AUTO is almost the same as INT, which just move
the uCondition to the macro.
