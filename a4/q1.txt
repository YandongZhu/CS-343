i) 
the input value is 100 10 80000 
* the result is average by 3 experiment

			Mutex/Condition 	Barrier 	Semaphore
user			16.18u				 16.08u		 16.02u
real 		 0:16.20r		  	0:16.08r	0:16.02r

ii)
Barrier and Semaphore is obviously faster than mutex condition lock. 
Because all thread run concurrentlly before they meet the 
criticial session, in this case is meet the group number to 
vote, while mutex/condition runs sequentially at the beginning 
of the 'vote' function, which waste more time. Which means the 
criticial session size in Barrier and Semaphore is smaller than the size in mutex condition lock.
